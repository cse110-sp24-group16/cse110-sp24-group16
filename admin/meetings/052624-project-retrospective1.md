## Activities to Avoid in the Future:

1. **Hastily Assigning Groups:**
   - Avoid hastily putting people in groups without assigning specific roles. This can lead to confusion and inefficiency.

2. **Lack of Clear Task Lists:**
   - Ensure there is a clear task list (not just issues, but detailed tasks). This helps in better planning and execution.

## Activities to Continue:

1. **Assigning Specific Roles:**
   - Continue assigning specific roles to team members. This helps in clarifying responsibilities and improving productivity.

2. **Meetings and Reviews:**
   - Maintain regular meetings and reviews to discuss progress and address challenges. These are essential for good general communication and team alignment.

## New Activities to Start:

1. **Progress Updates with Visuals:**
   - Consider updating group progress with pictures or videos. This can provide a clearer and more engaging way to track progress.

2. **Clearer Task Lists:**
   - Develop a more detailed and clear task list for team members. This will help in better understanding and execution of tasks.
