-	Daniil believes we performed well in executing our deadlines, performed good documentation for users, commits done properly and smoothly, no issues, teams performed jobs well. 
-	Wilson believes that there was a lot of good communication within the design team and a proactive approach to starting their work. A lot of back and forth within the group about brainstorming and creating sketches/designs.
-	Hisham believes HTML team worked well. They worked on formatting efficiently and believe that the design team helped in easily describing the task at hand.
-	Matthew Fang believes that the JS team held Zoom meetings  within the JS team and the HTML team to communicate issues and discuss plans to fix issues. Points out a focus on functionality over appearance in early iterations.
-	Sam believes that the CSS team performed well as they believe that the mockup from the design was brought to life by the CSS work. Functions well in multiple device types, and generally design elements were up to specification from the design team. 
-	Jordan believes that design being completed quickly allowed other teams to be able to plan out their work much earlier. 
-	Andrew believes that there was some struggle reading JSON documentation, but eventually was worked out by the deadlines. 
-	Michelle speaks about the success of creating the general framework, calendar features, and headers.
-	Neelkanth believes that the design team worked well together to work on each others improvements. However, he thinks that there could have been better communication (through zoom or slack meetings) to understand what each person was thinking throughout the week.
-	Overall: Distribution of work was performed efficiently
