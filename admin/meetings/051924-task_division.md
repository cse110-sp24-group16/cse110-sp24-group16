# EL PLAN

## Future

### Weekly View
- **Start on Sunday**
- **Task List (Sidebar)**
  - Located on the left
  - Prioritize late tasks

### Task Interaction
- **Click a Task**
  - Opens the task overlay menu with various functions

### Adding Tasks
- **Two Methods**
  - Using the `+` sign on the task list (priority)
  - Dragging on the calendar

### Deleting Tasks
- Must be a two-step process

### Navigation
- Switch weeks using arrows located at the top near the date

## Backlog

### Monthly View
- **Sidebar**
  - Displays top impact tasks on the left

### Heatmap
- **Color Scheme**
  - Should probably be one color, preferably blue

### Journal Entries
- Clicking a day opens the journal entry for that day
- Viewing a journal entry should function the same as editing a task in the calendar

### Sidebar Consistency
- The sidebar should be the same for both the task list and backlog, but pool different information

### Task Descriptions
- Should support Markdown
- Task descriptions and journal entries are essentially the same

## Extra Features
- **Animations**
- **fzf (fuzzyfind) for Task Search**
- **Tags**
  - Add tags
  - Search by tag

### Accessibility
- Implement at least some accessibility features (e.g., colors or descriptions)

### Miscellaneous
- GitHub integration
- Keybinds
- Noscript troll: `sudo rm -rf /`
- Monthly widget to choose the week for task list view

## Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Testing and Review**
  - Different levels of testing and review for different branches
  - Add End-to-End (E2E) testing with Puppeteer
