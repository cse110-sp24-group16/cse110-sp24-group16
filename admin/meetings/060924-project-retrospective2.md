## Activities to Avoid in the Future:

1. **Overloading with Features:**
   - Avoid adding too many features at once. Focus on developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) before expanding functionality. This will help ensure core features are polished and fully functional before adding more complexity.

2. **Late-Week Meetings:**
   - Instead of holding meetings towards the end of the week when tasks are nearly completed, schedule meetings earlier in the week. This allows for better planning and understanding of the weekâ€™s objectives, ensuring everyone is aligned from the start.

3. **Premature Feature Development:**
   - Focus on perfecting one feature at a time before moving on to the next. This will help reduce errors and ensure each feature is thoroughly tested and functional before integrating additional functionalities.

4. **Late Testing in Sprint Cycle:**
   - Avoid starting testing late in the sprint cycle. Incorporate testing throughout the development process to identify and address issues early, improving overall quality and reducing last-minute fixes.

5. **Unassigned Feature Allocation:**
   - Instead of allowing team members to freely assign themselves to features, implement a system where features are assigned by a project manager or team lead. This approach ensures a balanced distribution of responsibility and accountability.

## Activities to Continue:

1. **Task Division:**
   - Continue dividing tasks among team members to ensure clear responsibilities and efficient progress on different aspects of the project.

2. **Regular Meetings:**
   - Maintain regular meetings to discuss progress, address challenges, and coordinate efforts. These meetings are crucial for keeping the team aligned and informed.

3. **Slack Communication:**
   - Keep using Slack for effective and timely communication. It facilitates quick discussions, instant updates, and helps maintain a collaborative environment.

## New Activities to Start:

1. **Decreasing Feature Load:**
   - Start by implementing a smaller feature set initially. This approach allows for a more focused development process, ensuring that each feature is well-developed and functional before expanding.

2. **Creating Tests for New Features:**
   - Implement a practice of writing tests concurrently with new feature development. This ensures that each new feature is thoroughly tested for functionality and integration, improving overall product quality and reliability.
