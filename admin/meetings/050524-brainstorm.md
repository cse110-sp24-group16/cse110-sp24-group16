# Tasks :
- Discussed what tasks need to be completed by Sunday night: _Brainstorming Activity, Starting Pitch_
- Focused on what will be done on the upcoming week and general due dates for the near future 

## Brainstorming Activity:
- Created a Miro board with user stories and possible features
- https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKRuSIyU=/
- This miro board contains
- 1. User Stories  
  2. Possible Features  
  3. Research

- Discussed good programming practices and which features to develop first based on necessity and how essential they would be to the user


## Starting Pitch:
- Chose to use a Google slide deck for the starting pitch
- Laid out the structure for the slides and organized by necessary topics to cover in the pitch including background, risks, rabbit holes, and wireframes
- Examples of Slide Deck:

- Divided work equally and worked on the slides to serve as an effective pitch
- Discussed briefly about using a website or app to develop or journal and the pros and cons of each of them

## Additional Points of Discussion 
- Feedback Collection: Consider implementing mechanisms to gather feedback from potential users or stakeholders regarding the proposed features and design concepts. This feedback can help refine the project's direction and prioritize development efforts effectively.  
- User Persona Development: Begin creating user personas based on target audience demographics, preferences, and needs. User personas can provide valuable insights into user behavior and motivations, guiding decision-making throughout the development process.  
- Competitor Analysis: Conduct a thorough analysis of existing solutions or competitors in the market to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for differentiation. This analysis can inform feature prioritization and help position the project effectively in the market.  
- Prototype Development: Start prototyping key features and user interfaces to visualize the user experience and gather early feedback from stakeholders. Prototypes can help validate design decisions and identify potential usability issues before investing in full-scale development.  
- Agile Planning: Consider adopting agile methodologies such as Scrum or Kanban for project management and development. Agile approaches emphasize iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility, enabling teams to respond to changing requirements and deliver value incrementally.  
- Documentation: Emphasize the importance of maintaining comprehensive documentation throughout the project lifecycle, including requirements specifications, design documents, and user manuals. Clear documentation facilitates collaboration, knowledge sharing, and future maintenance efforts.  
- Testing Strategy: Define a testing strategy encompassing unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing to ensure the reliability, performance, and usability of the application. Establish testing criteria, methodologies, and tools to maintain product quality and minimize post-release issues.
