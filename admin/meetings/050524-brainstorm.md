## Overall Plan:
# EL PLAN

## Future

### Weekly View
- **Start on Sunday**
- **Task List (Sidebar)**
  - Located on the left
  - Prioritize late tasks

### Task Interaction
- **Click a Task**
  - Opens the task overlay menu with various functions

### Adding Tasks
- **Two Methods**
  - Using the `+` sign on the task list (priority)
  - Dragging on the calendar

### Deleting Tasks
- Must be a two-step process

### Navigation
- Switch weeks using arrows located at the top near the date

## Backlog

### Monthly View
- **Sidebar**
  - Displays top impact tasks on the left

### Heatmap
- **Color Scheme**
  - Should probably be one color, preferably blue

### Journal Entries
- Clicking a day opens the journal entry for that day
- Viewing a journal entry should function the same as editing a task in the calendar

### Sidebar Consistency
- The sidebar should be the same for both the task list and backlog, but pool different information

### Task Descriptions
- Should support Markdown
- Task descriptions and journal entries are essentially the same

## Extra Features
- **Animations**
- **fzf (fuzzyfind) for Task Search**
- **Tags**
  - Add tags
  - Search by tag

### Accessibility
- Implement at least some accessibility features (e.g., colors or descriptions)

### Miscellaneous
- GitHub integration
- Keybinds
- Noscript troll: `sudo rm -rf /`
- Monthly widget to choose the week for task list view

## Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Testing and Review**
  - Different levels of testing and review for different branches
  - Add End-to-End (E2E) testing with Puppeteer


## Additional Points of Discussion 
- Feedback Collection: Consider implementing mechanisms to gather feedback from potential users or stakeholders regarding the proposed features and design concepts. This feedback can help refine the project's direction and prioritize development efforts effectively.  
- User Persona Development: Begin creating user personas based on target audience demographics, preferences, and needs. User personas can provide valuable insights into user behavior and motivations, guiding decision-making throughout the development process.  
- Competitor Analysis: Conduct a thorough analysis of existing solutions or competitors in the market to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for differentiation. This analysis can inform feature prioritization and help position the project effectively in the market.  
- Prototype Development: Start prototyping key features and user interfaces to visualize the user experience and gather early feedback from stakeholders. Prototypes can help validate design decisions and identify potential usability issues before investing in full-scale development.  
- Agile Planning: Consider adopting agile methodologies such as Scrum or Kanban for project management and development. Agile approaches emphasize iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility, enabling teams to respond to changing requirements and deliver value incrementally.  
- Documentation: Emphasize the importance of maintaining comprehensive documentation throughout the project lifecycle, including requirements specifications, design documents, and user manuals. Clear documentation facilitates collaboration, knowledge sharing, and future maintenance efforts.  
- Testing Strategy: Define a testing strategy encompassing unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing to ensure the reliability, performance, and usability of the application. Establish testing criteria, methodologies, and tools to maintain product quality and minimize post-release issues.
