## Context and Problem Statement

Many journals have ways to create tasks for future events in addition to journal entries for the present and past. The question is whether or not we should include such a feature into our own journal.

## Considered Options

* Only Journal Entries
* Add Task List in addition to Journal Entries

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Add Task List in addition to Journal Entries", because it is almost an expected feature and it will not interfere with the functionality and useability of the application as a whole in any detrimental way.

### Consequences

* Good, because it will add much more functionality and makes sense for something that will be accessed on a daily basis.
* Bad, because it will require more dev time in order to design, create, and test.
