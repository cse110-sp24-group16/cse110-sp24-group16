# Unit Testing Framework

* Status: Approved
* Deciders: Everyone
* Date: 06/08/2024

## Context and Problem Statement

Testing is a crucial part of the development process to ensure that our journaling app is reliable, maintainable, and free of bugs. There are various frameworks available for conducting unit tests, each with its own advantages and trade-offs. The challenge is to select a unit testing framework that is robust, widely adopted, and fits well with our development workflow.

## Considered Options

* Mocha
* Jest

## Decision Outcome

### Chosen option:
* __Framework__: Mocha

### Justification

* In Electron, Jest is not immediately accessible as a testing framework. Therefore, Mocha is a flexible and widely-used JavaScript testing framework that provides a rich set of features for testing asynchronous code.

## Positive Consequences

* __Flexibility__: Mocha’s flexibility allows us to tailor the testing setup to our specific needs, integrating with other tools and libraries seamlessly.
* __Community and Support__: The large user base and active community provide a wealth of plugins, extensions, and resources, facilitating easier troubleshooting and learning.
* __Asynchronous Testing__: Mocha’s robust support for asynchronous testing aligns well with our app's requirements, ensuring reliable testing of asynchronous code.

## Negative Consequences

* __Setup Complexity__: Mocha may require more setup and configuration compared to some other frameworks, potentially increasing initial setup time.
* __Learning Curve__: New team members unfamiliar with Mocha may face a learning curve, necessitating additional training or documentation.
