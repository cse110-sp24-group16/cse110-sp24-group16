# Journal: Monthly View or Yearly View

## Context and Problem Statement

When creating a journal, there are many ways to display past information and entries. You can either use a monthly view which only shows the month or you can use a yearly one that will show the entire year.

## Considered Options

* Monthly
* Yearly

## Decision Outcome

Chosen options:

* __Monthly__: Due to the nature of the journal being geared towards developers, a monthly view is more convient as many developers are involved in agile workflows which are typically short time frames. Thus, the most important information will likely be within the month. Users can go to other months as they with.

## Positive Consequences

* __Speed__: Having information for only the month will improve speed of the site as well as speed of the user given they are looking for information in that month.
* __Visual__: Having only a month will allow you to have more space and thus given the webpage more breathing room which improves aesthetics and makes it easier to design.

## Negative Consequences

* __User Flow__: A monthly view will require users to click more in order to see information if the information they are looking for is not within the month they are in. This will be particularly painful when it comes to start of months where information will be in the previous month.
